# Algerian-Forest-Fire-Prediction
I processed and cleaned the Algerian forest fire dataset, analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). Using Logistic Regression, I applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to assess performance. After developing the model, I saved it as pickle files and tested it on unseen data for validation.
